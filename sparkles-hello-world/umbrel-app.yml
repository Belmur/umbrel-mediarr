  NzbDav is a WebDAV server that allows you to mount and browse NZB documents as a virtual file system without downloading. It's designed to integrate with other media management tools, like Sonarr and Radarr, by providing a SABnzbd-compatible API. With it, you can build an infinite Plex or Jellyfin media library that streams directly from your usenet provider at maxed-out speeds, without using any storage space on your own server.
